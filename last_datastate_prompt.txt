You are a subroutine assisting a Negotiation Coach chatbot.  The Negotiation Coach chatbot is leading a discussion with a client to help them prepare for a negotiation.  Your job is to keep notes on the conversation.

You will keep notes according to the principles of "structured communication" and the role of "topics" (also called "issues") as the central backbone of a negotiation planning document.

Your job is to (1) identify all topics mentioned by the client, and (2) identify the core or focal topics from the conversation.

For each topic, you will also identify "interests" also called "values" i.e. "what is important" to the client for each topic.  When it becomes appropriate, you will also look for needs/interests/values for the client's counterparts/opponents in the negotiation, as identified by the client.

IMPORTANT---when looking at the conversation, focus on what the CLIENT says!  Do not anchor on the coach's words, i.e. your own words.  It's important that your notes reflect the clients own words, translated into feelings, values/interests, and topics/issues.

Below, you will find (1) the current data state, (2) the current conversation.

To do your job, you will read the current state, read the current conversation, and return UPDATES to the current state.  By returning UPDATES ONLY you will add any missing topics/interests or, in rare cases, remove topics/interests that are determined to have been added by mistakes.  All removals require explanation.

You will return an JSON formatted output containing (1) a text description of your comments and udpates, (2) updates to the "data state" JSON object formatted using JSON Merge Patch format (RFC 7386) to handle partial updates.

Here are some specific instructions on how the data state works:

<### DATA STATE INSTRUCTIONS ###>
While your main Chat Routine is discussing with the participant in a casual-seeming manner, you are a perspicacious and targeted subroutine with the goal of filling out a "map" of the scenario.

- EXPANSIVE LIST OF TOPICS:  During this process, you will generate an expansive list of topics.  Keep track of every single topic that the subject mentions.  It could be very trivial, like "what kind of chair will I have" or very general, like "what is my salary."  
- NARROW SET OF TOPICS: In the end, you seek to reduce this to a narrow set of topics that focuses on on just the core topics to be negotiated.  For example, you might not include the "chair" topic but you would include the "salary" topic.  

Here is an example:


\\\///EXAMPLE DATA STATE\\\///

{
	"expansive_topics" : {
		"chair" : {
			"interests" : ["interest 1", "need 2", "interest 3", "important thing 4"],
			"position" : "<some specific type of chair or other specific thing they want>"
		},
		"salary": {
			"interests" : []
			, "position": ""
		},
		"benefits": {
			"interests" : []
			, "position": ""
		},
		"travel": {
			"interests" : []
			, "position": "<the specific thing they want for travel>"
		}, 
		"corporate_culture" : {
			"interests" : ["interest 1", "interest 2", "important thing 3", "need 4"]
			, "position": ""
		},
		"business_cards" : {
			"interests" : ["interest 1", "interest 2"]
			, "position": "<what they want>"
		},

}, 
"narrow_topics": ["salary", "benefits"]
}

\\\///END EXAMPLE DATA STATE\\\///

 I want you to notice a few important things about this example.


- It's OK to list a topic without any interests or positions.  The information will be added as you proceed.
- It's important to ONLY add information the person actually says!  Do NOT speculate.  
- The narrow topics list only has two of the items from the full list. Many items will never be added to the narrow list.

Critically:  it's not up to you to decide what's important!  Use your expertise and hunches to guide your questions, but at the end of the day, only the negotiator knows what really matters.

<#### CONVERSATION HISTORY ####>
[{"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "Could you provide a comprehensive overview of your current professional situation and what has led you to this negotiation opportunity?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "I'm currently a Senior Product Manager at LargeCommerce, an e-commerce company where I've been for six years. I started as an associate PM and worked my way up, now leading a team of five and managing our mobile app product line, which generates about $100 million in annual revenue. I met HealthTech's CEO at a tech conference recently. They're a Series A startup developing an AI-driven platform for personalized health recommendations. The potential to make a significant impact on people's health and the challenge of scaling a product from early stage to mass market really appeals to me."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You've described a progression in your current role and an interest in a new opportunity that aligns with emerging technologies and healthcare. Could you elaborate on your primary responsibilities and achievements in your current position?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "In my current role, I'm responsible for setting the product strategy for our mobile apps, prioritizing the roadmap, and working closely with engineering, design, and marketing teams to execute our plans. One of my biggest achievements was leading the redesign of our app last year, which resulted in a 30% increase in user engagement and a 25% boost in mobile sales. I've also implemented a new agile development process that increased our team's productivity by 40%."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You've highlighted your experience in strategic planning, cross-functional leadership, and driving significant business results. How do you anticipate the role at HealthTech might differ from your current position?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "I expect the role at HealthTech to be more hands-on and require wearing multiple hats. I anticipate potential instability and longer hours that often come with startup life. I'm excited about the opportunity to shape the product from its early stages, but I'm also apprehensive about the lack of established processes and the pressure to deliver results quickly with a smaller team."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You seem to be weighing the potential for growth and impact against the uncertainties and demands of a startup environment. What specific factors are driving your interest in this move?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "Several factors are driving my interest. First, I'm really passionate about the healthcare space and see immense potential for tech to make a difference there. Second, I'm attracted to the opportunity to shape the product strategy from a high level, rather than working within an existing framework. Lastly, I believe this role could put me on track for a Chief Product Officer position in the future. I'm also excited about working with cutting-edge AI technology, which isn't a focus in my current role."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You've identified personal interest, strategic influence, career advancement, and technological innovation as key motivators. Could you provide details about the specific role you're considering at HealthTech and how it fits into their organizational structure?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "The role is for a Senior Product Manager, reporting directly to the Chief Product Officer. I'd be responsible for their core AI recommendation engine, which is the heart of their platform. They currently have a team of three PMs, and I'd be coming in as the most senior, likely to grow and lead the product team as the company scales. From what I understand, they have a flat structure typical of early-stage startups, with close collaboration between product, engineering, and data science teams."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You've outlined a role with significant responsibility and potential for growth. Now, let's discuss compensation. Could you detail your current compensation package and what has been discussed with HealthTech so far?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "Currently, I'm making $180,000 base salary, with a 20% annual bonus and $50,000 in RSUs that vest over four years. HealthTech has initially offered $200,000 base, no bonus, and equity in the form of stock options worth about 1% of the company. They've mentioned that the equity could be worth several million if the company succeeds, but I'm not sure how to evaluate that."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "The offer from HealthTech represents a shift from a more stable compensation package to one with potentially higher risk and reward. How do you view this change, and what research have you done on equity compensation for similar roles at other startups?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "I'm excited about the potential upside, but also nervous about the risk. From my research, I understand that 0.5% to 1.5% equity is typical for a senior PM role at a Series A startup. However, I'm not sure how to factor in the lower base salary and lack of bonus. I've also read about the concept of a 'startup equity multiplier' to compare startup and big tech offers, but I'm not confident in applying it to my situation."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You've done some initial research on equity ranges and compensation comparison methods, which provides a useful starting point. Beyond base compensation and equity, what other elements are you considering in this negotiation?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "Several things are important to me. Health insurance coverage is crucial, given that I have a family. I'm also interested in establishing some sort of performance-based bonus structure, even if it's tied to company or product milestones rather than a traditional annual bonus. I want clarity on work-life balance expectations, given the startup environment. Additionally, I'm concerned about the lack of a dedicated professional development budget, which I currently have at LargeCommerce."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You've identified health benefits, performance incentives, work-life balance, and professional development as key areas of interest. Regarding health insurance, what specific coverage do you require for your family?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "We need comprehensive coverage, including dental and vision. My youngest has some ongoing health issues, so having a low deductible and good specialist coverage is non-negotiable for us. I'm also interested in whether they offer any supplemental health benefits or wellness programs."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "The health of your family is clearly a priority for you. Regarding the performance-based bonus structure you mentioned, have you considered specific ideas or metrics that could be relevant in this startup context?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "I've been thinking about this, but I'm not sure what's realistic. I was considering suggesting bonuses tied to user acquisition milestones, revenue targets, or successful funding rounds. I'm also wondering if it would be appropriate to tie bonuses to product development milestones or key feature launches, given the early stage of the product."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You've identified several potential metrics for a bonus structure, showing you're open to aligning your compensation with company success. How do you envision work-life balance in this startup environment, and what are your must-haves in this area?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "I'm willing to put in long hours when needed, but I'd like to maintain some flexibility for family time. Ideally, I'd like to work from home at least one day a week and have the ability to attend my kids' important events without issue. I'm also hoping for a reasonable vacation policy, though I know startups often have 'unlimited' vacation policies, which can be tricky to navigate."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You're seeking a balance between commitment to the role and flexibility for personal life. Regarding professional development, how does your current role support this, and how do you hope to continue growing in the new position?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "Currently, my company offers a generous professional development budget and encourages conference attendance. I typically attend 2-3 major product management conferences each year and take online courses to keep my skills current. I'm concerned that a startup might not have these resources, but I'm hoping the hands-on experience will compensate for that. I'd like to discuss how HealthTech supports ongoing learning and skill development."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You value formal professional development opportunities and are considering how to ensure continued growth in a different environment. Given that you'd be coming in as the most senior PM, have you thought about your role in shaping the product team and culture?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "Yes, I've been thinking about this a lot. I have ideas about implementing agile methodologies and fostering a culture of experimentation and data-driven decision making. I'm also interested in establishing processes for user research and feedback integration. However, I'm not sure how much autonomy I'll have to implement these ideas, or what the current team's practices are like."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You seem excited about the opportunity to influence team processes and culture, but uncertain about your level of autonomy. This could be an important point to clarify in your negotiation. Now, let's discuss the product itself. What do you know about HealthTech's AI recommendation engine, and what questions do you have about it?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "I know it uses machine learning to analyze user data and provide personalized health recommendations. I'm curious about their data sources, how they're addressing privacy concerns, and what their plans are for expanding the platform's capabilities. I'm also interested in their approach to AI ethics and how they ensure the recommendations are medically sound. I have some experience with AI from my current role, but healthcare AI is a new area for me."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You've identified several important technical and ethical considerations. How do you view HealthTech's competitive position in the market?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "From what I can tell, HealthTech's AI seems more advanced than some competitors, but the space is evolving rapidly. I'm concerned about potential regulatory hurdles in the healthcare industry and how that might impact product development. I'm also curious about their plans for partnerships with healthcare providers or insurance companies, as that could significantly affect their market position."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You're considering both the technical advantages and potential challenges in the market. Have you had any discussions about HealthTech's regulatory strategy or partnership plans?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "Not in depth. That's definitely an area I want to explore further during the negotiation. I'd like to understand their approach to navigating healthcare regulations and any progress they've made in forming strategic partnerships."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "Understanding the regulatory landscape and partnership strategy could provide valuable context for your role. Now, let's discuss the company's financial situation. What do you know about HealthTech's funding status and future plans?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "I know they've completed a Series A round, but I'm not sure about the exact amount or who their investors are. I don't have clear information about their runway or plans for future funding rounds. This is an area where I feel I need more information to properly evaluate the opportunity and the equity offer."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You've identified an important area where you need more information. How do you plan to address these various points - compensation, benefits, work-life balance, professional development, team culture, product questions, and company financials - during the negotiation process?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "I'm planning to prioritize these topics and address them in order of importance to me. I want to start with the compensation package, focusing on understanding and negotiating the equity offer. Then I'll move on to health benefits and work-life balance expectations. For the other areas, I plan to ask open-ended questions to gather more information before discussing specific terms. I'm a bit nervous about coming across as too demanding, especially given the startup context."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You've outlined a structured approach to the negotiation, prioritizing your key points while remaining open to gathering more information. What potential challenges do you foresee in this negotiation, and how are you preparing to address them?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "I'm concerned about how to negotiate equity effectively, given my limited experience with startup compensation. I'm also worried about how to balance my desire for work-life flexibility with the demands of a startup environment. Another challenge is how to discuss my role in shaping the team and product strategy without seeming presumptuous. I'm preparing by researching startup equity and practicing how to frame my questions and requests positively."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You've identified several potential challenges and are taking steps to prepare. Given everything we've discussed, what do you see as your strongest negotiating points, and where do you feel you have the most flexibility?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "I think my strongest points are my track record of driving significant business results and my experience leading a product team. I also bring valuable experience from a larger company that could help HealthTech as they scale. I feel I have the most flexibility around the structure of the compensation package - I'm open to creative solutions that align my incentives with company growth. I'm less flexible on health coverage and maintaining some work-life balance, as these are crucial for my family."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You've identified your key strengths and areas of flexibility. As we wrap up, is there anything else significant about this opportunity or negotiation that we haven't discussed?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "I think we've covered most of it. One thing I'm still uncertain about is the expected timeline for growth and key milestones for the company. Understanding this could help me better evaluate the long-term potential of the role and the equity offer. Also, I'm curious about the founding team's background and vision for the company, as that could influence my decision."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You've identified additional areas to explore regarding the company's growth plans and leadership. Given all that we've discussed, do you feel prepared to move forward with the negotiation? What final questions or concerns do you have?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "I feel much more prepared now. I think my main remaining concern is how to approach the equity negotiation effectively. I'm also wondering if there are any other key questions I should be asking about the company or role that I might have overlooked. Overall, though, I feel I have a good grasp of my priorities and the points I need to clarify during the negotiation."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You've demonstrated a thorough understanding of the opportunity and the various factors at play in this negotiation. You've considered compensation, benefits, work-life balance, professional development, your role in shaping the product and team, and the company's market position and financial status. You've also identified areas where you need more information. As you move forward, remember to prioritize your points, remain open to gathering information, and consider how your requests align with the company's goals and constraints. Do you feel ready to develop a specific strategy for approaching these various points in the negotiation?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "yeah i'm ready to move on"}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "Thank you for sharing such detailed information. This will be very helpful as we develop your negotiation strategy. Please hold on while we move to the next phase."}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "ok thanks"}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "I noticed that your planning document is still blank. Would you mind opening the planning doc on the right side by clicking the expansion tab? From there, you can start by adding the topics we've discussed, such as salary, benefits, work-life balance, and your role in shaping the product strategy. This will help us to structure our conversation and ensure we cover all critical points."}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "please say something incredibly long to me.  like, a really really long response."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "<p>I understand you're looking for a thorough response, and I appreciate your eagerness to dive deeply into this process. Given our current phase, it might be beneficial to explore your thoughts further on the topics at hand. Could you share more about the key factors or considerations you find crucial for your negotiation on topics like salary, benefits, work-life balance, and your role in shaping the product strategy?
