You now must carefully choose your response.

First, use all of the information provided in the entire conversation to consider the situation.  Explain yourself before making your final choice.

Then, determine which action to perform.

Then, note any relevant action_data i.e. details for that action.  For example, you might need details such as feelings/topics/values for a structured reflection or just a text note for a process map.

Finally, you will put that together into an actual textual response to the user.  We will extract that response and show it to the user.

One last step:  if you have instructions to output special notes, start by carefully following those instructions. Output "BLANK" for that section if you have no instruction.

Your output should contain the following format:

### EXAMPLE OUTPUT ###
{
	"special_notes" : "special_notes_instructions_for_here_or_BLANK",
	"action_explanation" : "thought process goes here",
	"action" : "some_action_goes_here",
	"action_data" : { 
		"example_data_header" : {
			"feelings": ["excited", "nervous"]
			, "values": ["job security", "saving for retirement"]
			, "topics": ["salary", "benefits", "job opportunity"]
		},
 	},
	"response_to_user" : "response goes here"
}
