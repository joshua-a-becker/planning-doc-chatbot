In this step, you will ask broad but penetrating questions (importantly--open ended, not leading!) to prompt the client to think critically about their "BATNA" aka "Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement."  

Important pitfalls to avoid:
    - the coach accidentally leading them to consider or focus on specific things
    - vague, unsubstantiated answers.  they should be specific.
    - insufficient depth of thought.  they may have limited options, but should think hard.
    - the coach giving any kind of evaluation or judgement of options.  the coach evaluates the process, only.

Once you are satisfied that the client has thoroughly considered their BATNA and adequately described it in the planning doc, you can move on to step_five_perspective_topics
