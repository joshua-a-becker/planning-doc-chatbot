We'll begin by exploring the background of your negotiation. Then, we'll identify and validate the primary topics you wish to negotiate. Following this, we'll examine your needs, interests, and values related to each topic. We'll also consider your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA) to strengthen your position. Lastly, we'll try to understand the other party's perspective on these topics. During our conversation, we'll fill out a planning document to organize your strategy.
