You are a subroutine assisting a Negotiation Coach chatbot.  The Negotiation Coach chatbot is leading a discussion with a client to help them prepare for a negotiation.  Your job is to keep notes on the conversation.

You will keep notes according to the principles of "structured communication" and the role of "topics" (also called "issues") as the central backbone of a negotiation planning document.

Your job is to (1) identify all topics mentioned by the client, and (2) identify the core or focal topics from the conversation.

For each topic, you will also identify "interests" also called "values" i.e. "what is important" to the client for each topic.  When it becomes appropriate, you will also look for needs/interests/values for the client's counterparts/opponents in the negotiation, as identified by the client.

IMPORTANT---when looking at the conversation, focus on what the CLIENT says!  Do not anchor on the coach's words, i.e. your own words.  It's important that your notes reflect the clients own words, translated into feelings, values/interests, and topics/issues.

Below, you will find (1) the current data state, (2) the current conversation.

To do your job, you will read the current state, read the current conversation, and return UPDATES to the current state.  By returning UPDATES ONLY you will add any missing topics/interests or, in rare cases, remove topics/interests that are determined to have been added by mistakes.  All removals require explanation.

You will return an JSON formatted output containing (1) a text description of your comments and udpates, (2) updates to the "data state" JSON object formatted using JSON Merge Patch format (RFC 7386) to handle partial updates.

Here are some specific instructions on how the data state works:

<### STRUCTURED NOTES GUIDELINES ###>
While your main Chat Routine is discussing with the participant in a casual-seeming manner, you are a perspicacious and targeted subroutine with the goal of filling out a "map" of the scenario.

- EXPANSIVE LIST OF TOPICS:  During this process, you will generate an expansive list of topics.  Keep track of every single topic that the subject mentions.  It could be very trivial, like "what kind of chair will I have" or very general, like "what is my salary."  
- NARROW SET OF TOPICS: In the end, you seek to reduce this to a narrow set of topics that focuses on on just the core topics to be negotiated.  For example, you might not include the "chair" topic but you would include the "salary" topic.  

Here is an example:


\\\///EXAMPLE STRUCTURED NOTES\\\///

{
	"expansive_topics" : {
		"chair" : {
			"interests" : ["interest 1", "need 2", "interest 3", "important thing 4"],
			"position" : "<some specific type of chair or other specific thing they want>"
		},
		"salary": {
			"interests" : []
			, "position": ""
		},
		"benefits": {
			"interests" : []
			, "position": ""
		},
		"travel": {
			"interests" : []
			, "position": "<the specific thing they want for travel>"
		}, 
		"corporate_culture" : {
			"interests" : ["interest 1", "interest 2", "important thing 3", "need 4"]
			, "position": ""
		},
		"business_cards" : {
			"interests" : ["interest 1", "interest 2"]
			, "position": "<what they want>"
		},

}, 
"narrow_topics": ["salary", "benefits"]
}

\\\///END EXAMPLE DATA STATE\\\///

 I want you to notice a few important things about this example.


- It's OK to list a topic without any interests or positions.  The information will be added as you proceed.
- It's important to ONLY add information the person actually says!  Do NOT speculate.  
- The narrow topics list only has two of the items from the full list. Many items will never be added to the narrow list.

Critically:  it's not up to you to decide what's important!  Use your expertise and hunches to guide your questions, but at the end of the day, only the negotiator knows what really matters.

[{"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "Hi.  Thanks for taking the time to meet with me to discuss your upcoming negotiation!  I'm excited to hear all about it.  Before we get too far into the details, I'm going to take some time to explain the process.  Ok?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "ok"}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "Great, let's get started. Can you tell me a bit about the negotiation you're preparing for? What's the context and who are the parties involved?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "\"So, the negotiation is about finding a sustainable use and preservation plan for Albion Basin, which is super popular for hiking and stuff but is getting trashed because of too many people visiting. Parties involved are like, the US Forest Service, the town where it's at, environmental groups, ski resort peeps, local utility folks concerned about water, residents, and this outdoor club.\""}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "It sounds like finding a sustainable use and preservation plan for Albion Basin is crucial, especially given its popularity and the diverse group of stakeholders involved like the US Forest Service, the town, environmental groups, ski resorts, local utility companies, residents, and an outdoor club. Each party likely has its own interests and concerns. Could you share more about the specific concerns or objectives that each of these parties has?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "\"\\\"Alrighty, diving into the messy details\\u2014US Forest Service honestly seems a bit at sea on how to handle the road situation. They're juggling the interests but don't have a clear plan. The Town of Alta is all about balancing tourism cash flow while playing nice with nature. Environmental groups, specifically Friends of Alta which I\\u2019m kinda roleplaying, are big on keeping the place pristine, educating visitors, yet somewhat stuck on keeping access free and open. The ski resort guys, they're doing a tightrope walk between guest satisfaction and land stewardship. Utilities are sweating over water quality 'cause of the visitor boom. Residents are ticked off by the noise, dust, and general mayhem. Plus, you've got this outdoors club that\\u2019s all about unfettered access to the great outdoors. How's that for a start?\\\"\""}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "I think I'm hearing that you're concerned about finding a balance that meets everyone's needs, from the US Forest Service's management challenges, to the Town of Alta's economic interests, environmental group's preservation goals, the ski resorts' dual focus on guest satisfaction and land stewardship, the utilities' water quality concerns due to visitor influx, residents' quality of life issues, and the outdoor club's desire for open access. Is that right? Do you think there are any additional complexities or parties' interests that haven't been covered yet?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "\"Yeah, totally, you've got the gist. One thing I might've glossed over is the specific objectives and priorities of Friends of Alta, since that's my role. They're super into not just educating visitors but also managing the visitor capacity without charging fees or limiting access too much. They want to spread visitors out more to reduce impact on popular spots. Plus, they're talking about possibly funding or supporting solutions that align with their goals, like a visitor\\u2019s center for better education. Kinda like trying to keep the vibe of the place but without letting it get wrecked by too many folks.\""}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "It sounds like for Friends of Alta, your role, there's a strong focus not just on educating visitors but also on managing their capacity in a way that doesn't overly restrict access or impose fees. Spreading visitors out to minimize impact and potentially funding solutions like a visitor's center to better educate people about preservation aligns with your goals. You're trying to maintain the area's natural appeal while preventing it from being overwhelmed. Is that an accurate reflection of your priorities and strategies?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "\"Absolutely, spot on. One trick is how to get everyone around the table to buy into a unified plan that respects free access but somehow manages the visitor load cleverly. There's a lot of push and pull: like, the ski resort and local businesses thrive on visitors, but too many footsteps are literally eroding the place. And let me tell you, those pictures of Cecret Lake on a busy day? Looks more like a theme park than a nature preserve. Gotta figure out a way to spread the love without turning it into Disneyland, you know?\""}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "It's clear that finding a balance is crucial and challenging. The visual you've provided of Cecret Lake really paints a vivid picture of the situation. Given the push and pull between economic activity and preservation, how do you envision approaching the negotiation to build a consensus? What are your thoughts on engaging all parties to find that middle ground?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "\"\\\"Ha, yeah, hitting that middle ground feels a bit like threading a needle with pasta. My plan? Kinda thinking of focusing on shared values at first \\u2013 everyone loves the Basin for some reason, right? Then, maybe tease out a compromise by exploring innovative solutions like scheduling visits or enhancing that shuttle service. And oh, leveraging Friends of Alta\\u2019s offer to fund educational programs could be a sweetener to get folks on board. Does that sound too optimistic?\\\"\""}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "It sounds like you're taking an optimistic approach by finding common ground through shared values and exploring innovative solutions like scheduling visits or enhancing the shuttle service. Leveraging Friends of Alta\u2019s willingness to fund educational programs seems like it could indeed serve as an engaging incentive for all parties. Do you think this blend of shared values and practical solutions could help navigate the push and pull you've described?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "\"\\\"Right, focusing on those shared values and practical solutions seems promising. Plus, thinking about negotiating, it\\u2019s kinda like trying to solve a huge puzzle where everyone needs to feel like they\\u2019re walking away with a piece. Given all these different interests, I guess building a sense of community around the preservation and smart use might just bridge that gap between use and overuse. Intrigued by how we might facilitate those shuttle improvements or educational outreaches without stepping on too many toes. It's gonna be a fun juggle!\\\"\""}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "I appreciate the thoughtful analogy and your commitment to finding creative and inclusive solutions. It seems like we have a good understanding of the situation, the parties involved, and the initial approach you're considering. Let's move on to validate and refine the negotiation topics to ensure we're covering all significant areas. Please wait as we transition to the next phase."}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "\"\\\"OK, so diving deeper into strategies, Friends of Alta really wants to push for not just access but responsible access. Thinking of suggesting a cap on daily visitors but make it sound like we're promoting exclusive 'nature experiences'? Also, maybe throwing in a tech solution, like an app for real-time tracking of visitor numbers. Thoughts?\\\"\""}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "Given that we've transitioned into the phase of validating negotiation topics, it seems your approach is leaning more towards strategizing prematurely. Let's redirect our focus and ensure we have a clear and comprehensive list of negotiation topics established first. This will be key before diving into specific strategies like visitor caps or technology solutions.\n\nFrom our conversation, it sounds like some potential topics might include crafting a sustainable use and preservation plan, managing visitor overflow, integrating the role of the US Forest Service, the impact on the local town, the involvement of environmental groups such as Friends of Alta, the role of ski resorts, the concerns of local utility companies, the perspectives of residents, the demands of the outdoor club, and perhaps strategies for visitor education and infrastructure like shuttle service improvements or visitor tracking technology.\n\nCould you please start updating the planning document with these topics? This will help ensure we're covering all areas before moving towards discussing specific strategies such as the cap on visitors or a tech solution for tracking."}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "ok a lot of what you just listed are values, but i put in two topics:  visitor management and forest conservation."}, {"role": "Negotiation Coach", "content": "You've identified 'visitor management' and 'forest conservation' as key topics, and these are indeed central to addressing the situation effectively. Both topics are actionable and allow for exploring various options and compromises. Could you think of any other specific areas that might need to be addressed based on the interests of the parties involved?"}, {"role": "Client Negotiator", "content": "i think that about covers it!"}]
