{"response_to_user": "Given the current phase we're in, which focuses on understanding your own needs, interests, and values around the topics we've identified\u2014'visitor management' and 'forest conservation'\u2014let's take a closer look at these areas. It will be essential for you to articulate what you aim to achieve or preserve in each of these topics, as this will guide our negotiation preparation effectively.\n\nLooking at your planning document, I see that these sections are still blank under 'visitor management' and 'forest conservation'. \n\nFor 'visitor management', earlier, for example, I noticed you mentioned the importance of managing visitor capacity and promoting responsible access without imposing fees or severely limiting access. Could you elaborate on what specific needs or interests this entails for Friends of Alta? This might include, but is not limited to, environmental sustainability, visitor experience, or educational outreach.\n\nAnd regarding 'forest conservation', what are the primary goals and interests? These could involve preserving natural habitats, ensuring the long-term health of forested areas, or maybe something related to mitigating the impact of recreational use.\n\nThese reflections on your needs and interests will be pivotal in steering our discussions and strategies as we move forward.", "action": "", "data_state": {}}
